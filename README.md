# Homebrew Formula Analytics
Provides `brew formula-analytics` for Homebrew maintainers to be able to query [Homebrew's analytics](https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics) from the command-line.

This is restricted to maintainers only because it's not clear how to provide anonymous, read-only access to Google Analytics.
